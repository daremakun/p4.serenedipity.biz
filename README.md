===================
This is an upgraded version of my first project. this project allows users to sign up on a mini blog and share news event.The layout is a combination of bootstrap responsive template and a layout I saw from one of my classmates that I liked.

The Application includes:

1. Sign up
2. Share a post
3. Upload a picture/avatar 
4. Follow other users
5. Edit Post
6. Delete Post: Indicate that post has been deleted
7. Content Title: show poster, date posted and title
8. Error handling if pasword is less than 6 characters
9. Can't post an empty 'post'
10. Newsfeed showing at posts section
 


Javascript:
1. The newsfeed is driven by google's API using javascript
2. The hover active state for tabs are using javascript to drive the behavior.
3.  On the "Add Post" section, when you hover in the form/box, it should highlight on the side "Please post any latest news"
